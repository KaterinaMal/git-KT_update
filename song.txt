This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong, who would have guessed it?
I will not leave alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late, it's never too late

Even if I say, "It'll be all right"
Still I hear you say, you want to end your life

Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around, 'cause it's not too late, it's never too late
